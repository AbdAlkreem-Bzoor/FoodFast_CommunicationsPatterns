Hi Mr. Asem
For the setup instructions & testing guide, I won't deliver them on time because I learned bunch of topics in ASP.NET Core (like SignalR for WebSockets and SSE),
so it took me some time to get used to it, and I am not fully familiar with it, and tbh I had some personal matters that I had to take care of in the last week, I would love you to understand my situation

Thank you very much
Abdalkreem Bzoor
